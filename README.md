## Popular Topics in Data Science Education

This is the last guided project in Dataquest's Business Topics in Data Analysis step of the data analyst pathway. It is an analysis post information from Stack Exchange's Data Science site using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. *This is very much a work in progress*.  This is one of the most involved projects I've done through Dataquest and with the least guidance, so it's somewhat of a slow process. I will be updating as I work through it.  

Both datasets used were obtained by querying Stack Exchange's [SEDE](https://data.stackexchange.com/) tool.
